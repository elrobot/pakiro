Pakiro is a fun experiment to learn about kinect and roomba hacking using an ARM based brain.

We don't know where this will take us, the first step is reproducing the KinectBot experiment[1] and document it along the way.

The main architecture will be:

# Robot brains: Panda Board - http://pandaboard.org/ $174 (ARM A9 1GHz, 1GB DDR2 Ram, Running Ubuntu Linux)
# Main Sensor: Microsoft Kinect $150
# Robot body: iRobot Create $130
